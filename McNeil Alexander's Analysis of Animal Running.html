<p><b>The purpose of this webpage is to present and explain

 McNeil Alexander's analysis of animal running.  This analysis arose in

connection with estimating the running speed of dinosaurs.  One of the

few, perhaps the only, bits of data on the dynamics of dinosaurs is the

tracks of dinosaurs in mud which got turned into stone.  The dinosaur

tracks provide the stride length of various dinosaurs and their skeletons

would provide their leg lengths.  Where skeletons are not available the

foot size can be used to estimate leg length.  The ratio of stride

length to leg length is called the relative stride.  The relative stride

is a dimensionless number that is likely to be a crucial variable in

the dynamics of an animals running.

</b></p><p><b>McNeil Alexander took an engineering approach to analyzing the dynamics

of animal running.  Relative stride is one dimensionless variable in

the problem.  He looked for another dimensionless variable and found it

in the Froude number.  <a href="http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/froude.htm">Froude</a> in analyzing the problems of ship motion and

design constructed the ratio of speed squared to the product of a

characteristic length times the acceleration due to gravity; i.e.,

</b></p><h4><b><br>Froude number = (speed)<sup>2</sup>/(g·length)

<br>&nbsp;</b></h4><b>

<p>where g = 32 feet/sec/sec if length is in feet and speed is in feet/sec.



</p><p>What McNeil Alexander found is that for a wide variety of animals there

is a relationship between the Froude number for their running and  their relative

stride.  Specifically he found the statistical relationship

</p><h4><br>Froude number = 2.3(relative stride)<sup>0.3</sup><br>&nbsp;</h4>

<p>This relationship was found by fitting a regression line to the logarithms

of the Froude numbers and relative strides for his data sample.

</center>



<p>With this relationship McNeil Alexander was able to compute the

Froude number for the dinosaurs for which he had data on relative stride.

From the Froude numbers he could compute the speeds of the different

dinosaur species he had data for.  The estimated speeds turned out to

not be very large, about comparable to the walking speeds of humans.

</p><p>In his book McNeil Alexander characterizes the conjecture that there

would be a relationship between the relative strides of different animals

and the Froude numbers for their running as being a guess.   But in his

article for <i>Scientific American</i> he notes that the Froude number

is closely related to the ratio of kinetic energy and potential energy

for the running creatures.  This might provide an explanation of why

there should be a relationship between Froude numbers and relative strides

of different animals.



</p><p>The relative stride length determines the maximum angle between the

legs and, consequently, the variation in height of the center of gravity

during the course of a stride.  If the stride length is S and the leg

length is L then the maximum  leg angle α is 2sin<sup>-1</sup>((S/2)/L).

The height of the top of the leg at mid-stride is L and at maximum

stride is Lcos(α/2).  Thus the difference in the top of the leg

height and consequently also in the height of the center of gravity of

the creature during a stride is L(1-cos(α/2).



</p><p>Since sin(α/2)=(S/2)/L=(S/L)/2,

</p><h4><br>1-cos(α/2)=1-(1-(S/L)<sup>2</sup>/4)<sup>1/2</sup>

<br>&nbsp;</h4>

<p>The function 1-(1-x)<sup>1/2</sup> has a Maclaurin series of the 

form

</p><h4><br>x/2-x<sup>2</sup>/4+...

<br>&nbsp;</h4>

<p>The loss of energy during a complete stride is twice the work done in

reducing the angle between the legs from α to zero. If M is the

mass of the running creature and thus Mg is its weight (where g is the

acceleration due to gravity) then this work is

equal to MgL[1-(1-(S/L)<sup>2</sup>/4)<sup>1/2</sup>] which to the

first approximation is MgL(S/L)<sup>2</sup>/8.

</p><p>The maximum running speed of a creature may be related to the 

forces generated during running in relation to the strength of the

creature but the comfortable running speed for a creature is probably

related to other characteristics.

</p><p>Any structure or object has a natural frequency of oscillation.  For 

example a pendulum formed by a weight at the end of string of length

L has a natural frequency ω equal to (g/L)<sup>1/2</sup>.  The legs of

a creature may be consider pendula of roughly cylindrical form.  The

frequency of an object pivoted about some point is given by the

equation

</p><h4><br>ω = (mgh/I)<sup>1/2</sup>

<br>&nbsp;</h4>

<p>where m is the mass of the object, I is its moment of inertia and

h is the distance between the pivot point and the center of gravity

of the object.  For a thin cylinder of length L and mass m the moment of inertia 

is equal to mL<sup>2</sup>/3.  When the cylinder swings about one end

the distance h is L/2.  Thus the natural frequency of the cylinder is

</p><h4><br>

ω = [(mgL/2)/mL<sup>2</sup>/3]<sup>1/2</sup> = [3g/2L]<sup>1/2</sup>

<br>&nbsp;</h4>

<p>If the frequency of strides ω of a running creature is equal to the

natural frequency of its legs as pendula then

</p><h4><br>(ω<sup>2</sup>L)/g = 3/2

<br>&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the fraction on the left

by the square of the stride length S gives

</p><h4><br>(ω<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>L)/(gS<sup>2</sup>) = 3/2

<br>&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Dividing the numerator and denominator by L and a bit of rearrangement

gives the equation

</p><h4><br>(ω<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>)/(gL(S<sup>2</sup>/LS<sup>2</sup>) = 3/2

<br>&nbsp;</h4>

<p>But ωS is the same as the running speed of the creature v.

Thus

</p><h4><br>v<sup>2</sup>/gL = (3/2)(S/L)<sup>2</sup>

<br>&nbsp;</h4>

<p>The fraction on the left is the Froude number F and this equation give

the Froude number of a running creature as a function of its relative

stride (S/L); i.e.,

</p><h4><br>

F = (3/2)(S/L)<sup>2</sup>.

<br>&nbsp;</h4> <p> This is not the same relationship between the Froude

number and relative stride found by Alexander but it is such a

relationship.

</p><p>Note that the previous equation can be put into the form

</p><h4><br>[Mv<sup>2</sup>/2]/[MgL(S/L)<sup>2</sup>/8] = 3/4

<br>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>
where M is the mass of the creature.  The numerator of the fraction

on the left is the kinetic energy of the creature and the

denominator is the potential energy change during a stride and the

first approximation of the

work lost due to the up-and-down motion of the creature during a

stride.

</p><p>If MgL(S/L)<sup>2</sup>/8 is replaced by the exact value of

the work loss the resulting formula is



</p><h4><br>

F =  (3/2)[1-(1-(S/L)<sup>2</sup>/4])<sup>1/2</sup>]

<br>&nbsp;</h4>

<p>The exponent 0.3 in the equation found by Alexander corresponds to

 the derivative of ln(F) with respect to ln(S/L).  In the above

relation this derivative would depend upon the level of (S/L), but ranges between
1.0 and 
 2.0  and thus cannot match Alexander's measured figure of 0.3.
